# Resist AI – Multimodal Mental Health Assistant

A practical, human-centered AI system that understands user emotions from text, voice, and facial expressions, and provides supportive, context-aware guidance.

---

## What is Resist AI?

Resist AI is a multimodal emotion understanding system. It combines:

- Text sentiment (what the user writes)
- Voice cues (speech patterns and tone)
- Facial expressions (visual emotion detection)
- Environment context (AQI and temperature)

By integrating these signals, the system produces a more reliable mood estimate and generates helpful recommendations.

## Key Capabilities

- Text Analysis – detects mood and polarity from user input  
- Voice Analysis – converts speech to text (Whisper) and evaluates mood  
- Face Analysis – extracts dominant emotion from camera frames (DeepFace)  
- Multimodal Fusion – combines multiple signals for improved accuracy  
- Context-Aware Advice – adapts suggestions using AQI and temperature  
- Support Plan – generates short, actionable steps and daily check-ins

## How It Works (End-to-End)

1. **User Input**
   - The user provides input in the form of text, voice, or facial image.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Voice input is converted to text using Whisper.
   - Facial image is processed using DeepFace for emotion detection.
   - Text input is cleaned and normalized for analysis.

3. **Analysis**
   - Text and transcribed voice are analyzed to detect mood, sentiment polarity, and confidence score.
   - Facial data is used to identify dominant emotion.

4. **Multimodal Fusion**
   - Results from text, voice, and facial analysis are combined.
   - A final mood is determined using fusion logic.

5. **Context Integration**
   - Environmental data such as AQI and temperature is incorporated.
   - This helps generate more personalized recommendations.

6. **Advice Generation**
   - The system generates:
     - Mood assessment
     - Personalized suggestions
     - Daily actionable steps
     - Mental health check insights

7. **Final Output**
   - The user receives a complete response including:
     - Detected mood
     - Confidence score
     - Suggestions and guidance
     - Environmental context
